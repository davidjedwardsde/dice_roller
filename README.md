# dice_roller
Learning PySimpleGUI so I decided to make a simple D&amp;D dice roller app. Nothing fancy, but gets the job done. 

Please don't judge me too harshly - this is my first time using PySimpleGUI and I'm not a python expert by any means. This is just a silly little project to explore
the library.
